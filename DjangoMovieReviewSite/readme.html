Moviephile (name pending)

This is a project that I am working on that contains a few different projects.

The first part is a web scraper that collects data to build the database.
We take the movie titles, cast and img and add them to the database to be displayed later.

The main, user facing side is a Django web app. This lets users rate and review movies based
on specific criteria.  It's a bit different from sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb because
it separates the main parts of a movie into 10 different catagories.
