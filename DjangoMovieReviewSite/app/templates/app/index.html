        We make no reservations about the fact that we <i>don't</i> know what we're talking about.
        This site is for the self-taught wannabe movie reviewer.
        It's like you're friend that went to one wine tasting class and now pretends to like
        red wine even though everyone knows red wine is awful.
        So come in, take a seat, browse around. Below are a few different search options.
        You can search by movie title, or find reviews made by
        other people so that you can feel better about how much <i>you</i> know about movies.
