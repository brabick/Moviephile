    <h2>About Moviephile</h2>
    <p>
        We make no reservations about the fact that we <i>don't</i> know what we're talking about.
        This site is for the self-taught wannabe movie reviewer. <br />
        It's like you're friend that went to one wine tasting class and now pretends to like 
        red wine even though everyone knows red wine is awful. <br />
        So come in, take a seat, browse around. Below are a few different search options.
        You can search by movie title, or find reviews made by <br />
        other people so that you can feel better about how much <i>you</i> know about movies.
        <br />
