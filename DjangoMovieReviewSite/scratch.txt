Making progress!
The basic framwork parts are done.  I have figured out how to have a page that lists
all of the movies in the database and link them to an individual movie.  This didn't
take as long as I thought it would.
Next I need to...
Work on the model to display the scores.... 
Also finish creating the review table

Added movie title to all reviews per movie page
displaying correct records
custom message if no records exist.

Related as f!
Need to add:

Search,
Users,
Add reviews,
Admin Page (after users)

I really haven't been keeping up with this...
Users and User Groups are done! Right now you can create a default user and there is one
"staff" member, me!
We can also create movie reviews!  The movie_id and user_id are passed in, so we associate those
together.  We will be able to view all reviews by a specific user and such.
Next is to create the page that you get redirected to after creating a review.
We are ALMOST to the point where I can actually start styling this thing.

Auto summing total works, redirect to review after review is done works, just add data to that
page.  Also, navigating from the page that shows all reviews for a movie to the singular review
works
